# PerfectSyncForCC4
Reworks the default Arkit blendshapes and adds them to the CC4 extended profile. Supports ARKIT, and the Extended VseeFace blendshapes, minus the experimental Vrchat visemes. I haven't added those yet.

## Instructions

1. Save the file. 
2. Open up cc4.
3. Navigate to Facial Profile Editor
4. Click on import facial profile. That'll be the folder icon.
5. Optionally, select only the custom shapes. Otherwise, it'll add the complete extended profile.
6. When promoted, click "Add" rather than replace, unless you want to blow away your current profile.
7. Enjoy

This facial profile augments the CC4 extended profile.
