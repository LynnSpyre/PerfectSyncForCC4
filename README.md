# PerfectSyncForCC4
Reworks the default Arkit blendshapes and adds them to the CC4 extended profile. Supports ARKIT, and the Extended VseeFace blendshapes, minus the experimental Vrchat visemes. I haven't added those yet.

## Release Notes

### 0.0.3 - 8/2/2022
 * Removed all data from the facial profile that isn't arkit related. I'm going to create alternate profiles for emojis and vrchat style visemes in the future. 
 * Added bone baking for eyes and jaw, which should round out our profile
 * Switched profile from Extended to Standard to fix corruption bug.
 * As usual when installing, make sure to use "add" rather than "replace" mode, if you need the standard profile.


## Instructions

1. Save the file. 
2. Open up cc4.
3. Navigate to Facial Profile Editor
4. Click on import facial profile. That'll be the folder icon.
5. Optionally, select only the custom shapes. Otherwise, it'll add the complete extended profile.
6. When promoted, click "Add" rather than replace, unless you want to blow away your current profile.
7. Enjoy

This facial profile augments the CC4 extended profile.
