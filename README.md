# PerfectSyncForCC4
Reworks the default Arkit blendshapes and adds them to the CC4 standard profile. Supports ARKIT, with plans to support the Extended VseeFace blendshapes and experimental Vrchat visemes in the future.

## Release Notes

### 0.0.3 - 8/2/2022
 * Removed all data from the facial profile that isn't arkit related. I'm going to create alternate profiles for emojis and vrchat style visemes in the future. 
 * Added bone baking for eyes and jaw, which should round out our profile
 * Switched profile from Extended to Standard to fix corruption bug.
 * As usual when installing, make sure to use "add" rather than "replace" mode, if you need the standard profile.
 * Export tested in Blender 3.1
 * If you find a bug, hit me up at show@lynnspyre.com


## Instructions

1. Save the file. 
2. Open up cc4.

4. Click on import facial profile. That'll be the folder icon.
5. Optionally, select only the custom shapes. Otherwise, it'll add the complete extended profile.
6. When promoted, click "Add" rather than replace, unless you want to blow away your current profile.
7. Enjoy

This facial profile augments the CC4 extended profile.
